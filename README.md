------------------------------------------

Took data from trials with tumor drug regimens and removed any duplicated rows. Used this data to create a summary data frame with the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volumes.

Created a bar plots to compare the number of timepoint measurements taken per drug regimen. Created pie charts to show the distribution of male vs female mice in the trial.

Took the four most promising drug regimen trials and found the quartiles, IQRs, and outliers in the tumor size data. Generated a box and whisker plot to visualize this.
Took a random mouse from one of the drug regimen trials and created a line plot of their tumor size over time and a scatter plot of the mouse's weight compared to the tumor size. Found the correlation coefficient and plotted the linear regression model on top of the scatter plot.

---------------------------------------------

Runs in Jupyter Notebook from any terminal. Requires python.
